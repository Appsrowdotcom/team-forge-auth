# Status Change Logging & History View Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Status Change Logging and Status Timeline/History View features as requested. These features provide comprehensive audit logging and transparency for all status changes across projects and tasks in the Team Forge system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Status Change Logging

**What it does:**
- Automatically logs every status change for tasks and projects
- Records who made the change, when it was made, and what the new status is
- Ensures reliable logging even if users reload the page

**Implementation Details:**
- **TaskForm.tsx**: Added status change logging when creating/updating tasks
- **ProjectForm.tsx**: Added status change logging when creating/updating projects
- **Database Integration**: Inserts records into `status_history` table with proper error handling

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// INSERT INTO StatusHistory (project_or_task_id, status, updated_by, timestamp): log every status change for auditing.
const logStatusChange = async (taskId: string, newStatus: string, oldStatus?: string) => {
  // Only log if status actually changed
  if (oldStatus && oldStatus === newStatus) return;
  
  if (!profile?.id) {
    console.error('User not authenticated, cannot log status change');
    return;
  }

  try {
    const { error } = await supabase
      .from('status_history')
      .insert({
        entity_id: taskId,
        entity_type: 'task',
        status: newStatus,
        updated_by: profile.id,
        updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      });

    if (error) {
      console.error('Error logging status change:', error);
      // Don't fail the main operation if logging fails
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error logging status change:', error);
    // Don't fail the main operation if logging fails
  }
};
```

### 2. Status Timeline/History View

**What it does:**
- Displays a chronological timeline of all status changes for projects and tasks
- Shows the status, who updated it, and when the change occurred
- Provides a visual timeline with proper loading and empty states

**Components Created:**
- **StatusHistory.tsx**: Reusable component for displaying status history
- **ProjectDetail.tsx**: Detailed project view with status history
- **TaskDetail.tsx**: Detailed task view with status history

**Database Query Example:**
```typescript
// SELECT * FROM StatusHistory WHERE project_or_task_id = [id] ORDER BY timestamp ASC
const { data: statusData, error: statusError } = await supabase
  .from('status_history')
  .select('*')
  .eq('entity_id', entityId)
  .eq('entity_type', entityType)
  .order('updated_at', { ascending: true });
```

### 3. Enhanced Admin Dashboard

**What it does:**
- Integrates status history views into the existing admin interface
- Provides easy navigation between project/task lists and detail views
- Maintains existing functionality while adding new features

**New Features:**
- **View Details** buttons on project and task lists
- **Project Detail View**: Shows project information, statistics, and status history
- **Task Detail View**: Shows task information, statistics, and status history
- **Seamless Navigation**: Easy switching between different views

## Database Schema

The implementation uses the existing `status_history` table with the following structure:

```sql
status_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,           -- Project.id or Task.id
  entity_type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,  -- 'project' or 'task'
  status VARCHAR NOT NULL,           -- The new status value
  updated_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
)
```

## User Experience Features

### Loading States
- Skeleton loaders while fetching status history
- Smooth transitions between different views
- Clear indication when data is being loaded

### Empty States
- Friendly messages when no status history exists
- Clear explanations of what will appear
- Encouraging users to make status changes

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks if status logging fails
- User-friendly error messages
- Non-blocking implementation (main operations continue even if logging fails)

### Navigation
- Breadcrumb-style navigation between views
- Clear back buttons and action buttons
- Consistent UI patterns across all views

## Access Control

**Status History Visibility:**
- **Project Managers (PMs)**: Can view status history for all projects they manage
- **Team Members**: Can view status history for tasks assigned to them
- **Admins**: Can view status history for all projects and tasks

**Status Change Permissions:**
- **Admins**: Can change status of any project or task
- **Project Managers**: Can change status of projects they manage
- **Team Members**: Can change status of tasks assigned to them

## Technical Implementation

### Components Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ status-history.tsx          # Reusable status history component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ projects/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectDetail.tsx           # Project detail view with status history
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ProjectList.tsx             # Updated with view details button
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tasks/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ TaskDetail.tsx              # Task detail view with status history
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ TaskList.tsx                # Updated with view details button
â””â”€â”€ pages/
    â””â”€â”€ AdminDashboard.tsx              # Updated with detail view integration
```

### State Management

- Proper cleanup when switching between views
- Consistent state reset patterns across all handlers

### Data Fetching
- Efficient queries with proper error handling
- User name resolution for status history entries
- Real-time data updates when status changes occur

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Project Status History
