# Analytics Dashboard Documentation

## Overview

The Analytics Dashboard provides comprehensive insights into project time tracking, user productivity, and work patterns. It's designed to help administrators and project managers make data-driven decisions about resource allocation, project efficiency, and team performance.

## Features

### 1. Time Tracking Summary
- **Daily Breakdown**: Shows hours logged per day with user and project counts
- **Project Summary**: Time allocation across projects with completion rates
- **Key Metrics**: Total hours, average hours per day, peak day, and active projects
- **Time Range Filtering**: View data for day, week, month, quarter, or year

### 2. Project Analytics
- **Project Efficiency**: Compare actual vs estimated hours
- **User Breakdown**: See how team members contribute to each project
- **Completion Rates**: Track task completion progress
- **Deadline Monitoring**: Identify overdue projects
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by hours, efficiency, completion rate, or name

### 3. User Analytics
- **Individual Performance**: Track hours, tasks, and productivity per user
- **Work Patterns**: Peak hours, session lengths, and consistency metrics
- **Project Allocation**: See how users distribute their time across projects
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Compare actual vs estimated time for each user
- **Productivity Insights**: Completed tasks per hour worked

### 4. Work Pattern Analytics
- **Hourly Patterns**: Team activity throughout the day
- **Daily Patterns**: Productivity by day of the week
- **Team Metrics**: Overall efficiency and consistency
- **Productivity Insights**: Key performance indicators
- **Peak Performance**: Identify most productive times and users

## How to Use

### For Administrators

1. **Access Analytics**: Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and click the "Analytics" tab
2. **Select Time Range**: Choose from Today, This Week, This Month, This Quarter, or This Year
3. **Explore Different Views**: Use the tabs to switch between Summary, Project Analytics, User Analytics, and Work Patterns
4. **Filter Data**: Use dropdown menus to filter by specific projects or users
5. **Sort Results**: Click column headers or use sort dropdowns to organize data

### For Users

1. **Track Time**: Use the Time Tracker on your dashboard to log work hours
2. **Select Project**: Choose the project you're working on
3. **Optional Task**: Select a specific task if applicable
4. **Add Notes**: Describe what you're working on
5. **Start/Stop**: Click start to begin tracking, stop to save your session

## Data Sources

The analytics dashboard pulls data from the following database tables:

- **users**: User information and roles
- **projects**: Project details and status
- **tasks**: Task assignments and estimates
- **work_logs**: Time tracking entries with start/end times

## Key Metrics Explained

### Efficiency
- **Formula**: (Actual Hours / Estimated Hours) × 100
- **Interpretation**: 
  - < 80%: Under-estimated (good efficiency)
  - 80-120%: Well-estimated (normal efficiency)
  - > 120%: Over-estimated (poor efficiency)

### Productivity
- **Formula**: Completed Tasks / Total Hours
- **Interpretation**: Higher values indicate more tasks completed per hour

### Consistency
- **Formula**: 100 - (Standard Deviation of Daily Hours / Average Daily Hours) × 100
- **Interpretation**: Higher values indicate more consistent daily work patterns

### Completion Rate
- **Formula**: (Completed Tasks / Total Tasks) × 100
- **Interpretation**: Percentage of tasks that have been completed

## Time Tracking Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Start Tracking Early**: Begin tracking as soon as you start working
2. **Be Specific**: Select the correct project and task
3. **Add Notes**: Describe what you're working on for better insights
4. **Minimum Session**: Sessions must be at least 1 minute long
5. **Regular Updates**: Track time consistently throughout the day

### For Project Managers
1. **Set Realistic Estimates**: Provide accurate time estimates for tasks
2. **Monitor Progress**: Use analytics to identify bottlenecks
3. **Resource Allocation**: Use user analytics to optimize team assignments
4. **Deadline Management**: Track project deadlines and completion rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Data Showing**
   - Ensure users are actively tracking time
   - Check if the selected time range has data
   - Verify database connections

2. **Incorrect Metrics**
   - Check that task estimates are properly set
   - Ensure work logs have valid start/end times
   - Verify user assignments are correct

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Large datasets may take time to load
   - Consider reducing the time range for faster results
   - Check database query performance

### Data Validation

The system includes several validation checks:
- Work sessions must be at least 1 minute long
- End times must be after start times
- All required fields must be filled
- User and project references must be valid

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:
- **Export Functionality**: Download reports as CSV/PDF
- **Real-time Updates**: Live dashboard updates
- **Advanced Filtering**: More granular filtering options
- **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable dashboard layouts
- **Integration**: Connect with external time tracking tools
- **Notifications**: Alerts for overdue projects or low productivity

## Technical Implementation

The analytics dashboard is built using:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Charts**: Progress bars and custom visualizations
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
